# Flying Cars #

A flying car is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air.  Just like **Cora** which is designed by **Kitty Hawk**.

## Backyard Flyer ##
***Make a simulated drone fly in a square shape!***

In this project, we have written the **"Hello, world!"** of drone programming as we write event-driven code that causes a  quadrotor to take off, fly in a square, and land.

This project is the first project of Flying Car Nanodegree as an exercise of *Introduction to Autonomous Flight* section of the program.You can find more information about the implementation steps of this project on the project's own [README](/Backyard-Flyer/README.md) file. Also, You can visit the project's original [repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Backyard-Flyer) for further information.

## 3D Motion Planning ##
In this project, we've got a chance to apply what we've learned about **3D motion planning** from the *Planning* section classes to plan and execute a mission in a complex urban environment!

You can find more information about the implementation steps of this project on the project's own [README](Motion-Planning/README.md) file. Also, You can visit the project's original [repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning) for further information.

## Building a Controller ##

In this project, we've implemented a controller for a quadrotor in C++. Experimented on building **PID Controller** and **3D Dynamics** of a quadcopter.

You can find more information about the implementation steps of this project on the project's own [README](/Controls/README.md) file. Also, You can visit the project's original [repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Controls) for further information.

## Building an Estimator ##

In this project we've implemented an estimator to track the position and attitude of a quadrotor moving in three dimensions. Experimented on **Kalman Filters** **Estimation and Localization**.

You can find more information about the implementation steps of this project on the project's own [README](/Estimation/README.md) file. Also, You can visit the project's original [repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Estimation-CPP) for further information.
