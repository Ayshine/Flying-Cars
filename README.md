# Flying Cars #

This is the readme for the C++ project.

For easy navigation throughout this document, here is an outline:

 - [Backyard-Flyer](#Backyard Flyer)
 - [3D Motion-Planning](#3D Motion Planning)
 - [Building a Controller](#Building a Controller)
 - [Estimation](#Estimation)


## Backyard Flyer ##
In this lesson you'll write the "Hello, worl!" of drone programming as you write event-driven code that casues a  quadrotor to take off, fly in a square, and land.

Make a simulated drone fly in a square shape!

## 3D Motion Planning ##
In this project, you'll get a chance to apply what you've learned about 3D motion planning from the last several lessons to plan and execute a mission in a complex urban environment!

## Building a Controller ##

In this project you'll implement a controller for a quadrotor in C++.

## Estimation ##

In this project you'll implement an estimator to track the position and attitude of a quadrotor moving in three dimensions.
