# Flying Cars #

A flying car is a type of personal air vehicle or roadable aircraft that provides door-to-door transportation by both ground and air.  Just like Cora which is designed by Kitty Hawk.

This repository is built to showcase completed classroom projects of [Flying Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787) offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

This README is broken down into the following sections:

## Backyard Flyer ##
***Make a simulated drone fly in a square shape!***

In this project, we have written the "Hello, world!" of drone programming as we write event-driven code that causes a  quadrotor to take off, fly in a square, and land.

This project is the first project of Flying Car Nanodegree as an exercise of *Introduction to Autonomous Flight* section of the program.You can find more information about the implementation steps of this project on the project's own [README](/Backyard-Flyer/README.md) file. Also, You can visit the project's original [repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Backyard-Flyer) for further information.

## 3D Motion Planning ##
In this project, you'll get a chance to apply what you've learned about 3D motion planning from the last several lessons to plan and execute a mission in a complex urban environment!

## Building a Controller ##

In this project you'll implement a controller for a quadrotor in C++.

## Estimation ##

In this project you'll implement an estimator to track the position and attitude of a quadrotor moving in three dimensions.

## Setup ##
