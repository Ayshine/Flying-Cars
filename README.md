## Backyard Flyer ##
In this lesson you'll write the "Hello, worl!" of drone programming as you write event-driven code that casues a  quadrotor to take off, fly in a square, and land.

Make a simulated drone fly in a square shape!

## 3D Motion Planning ##
In this project, you'll get a chance to apply what you've learned about 3D motion planning from the last several lessons to plan and execute a mission in a complex urban environment!

## Building a Controller ##

In this project you'll implement a controller for a quadrotor in C++.

## Estimation ##

In this project you'll implement an estimator to track the position and attitude of a quadrotor moving in three dimensions.

## Setup ##
