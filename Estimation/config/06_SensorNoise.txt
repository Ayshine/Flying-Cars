# SigmaThreshold syntax:
# SigmaThreshold(signal, refValue, sigma, minOKPercent, maxOKPercent, okWindow)
#   looks at the percentage of points from <signal> being inside the range of [refValue-sigma, refValue+sigma]
#   if this percentage is inside [minOKPercent,maxOKPercent] for at least okWindow seconds,
#   the threshold visualization turns green
